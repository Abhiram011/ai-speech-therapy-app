# Repository Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to clean up the AI Speech Therapy App repository for public release.

## 🗑️ Files Removed

### Test and Development Files
- `test_app.py` - Test suite with hardcoded paths and test-specific code
- `test_personalization.py` - Response testing script with hardcoded imports
- `start_app.py` - Complex startup script with dependency installation logic
- `therapy_model/` - Empty directory

## 🔧 Code Cleanup
